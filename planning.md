##Planning

What are the core components of this project?

A user is able to input multiple pieces of text that is output by the extension

A user is able to input a cadence that text is output at

A user can drag and drop the extension sprite

The sprite is animated with different faces

Sprite display when not outputting text can be toggled to be hidden or not

##What are some use cases for this extension?

Water reminder - 1 text input and at a cadence of every 30 minutes

Pomodoro - 1 text input and at user set cadence (may need extra functionality to set breaks and work times automatically, focus on simple version for now)

Quotes - Many text inputs at a user set cadence

Browser buddy/focus helper - Cute little pieces of text at a random cadence

###How to input time to display text?
Have a simple numerical field where user can display text every X amount of time, and amount of time is customisable to be second, minutes, or hours
