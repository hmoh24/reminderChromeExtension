# Reminder Chrome Extension

## What motivated me to create his?

Programming is best learnt by doing. I want to deviate from the tutorials that I am following to try and turn an idea that I have into reality without knowing exactly how I will reach there.

By deviating from tutorials, I am allowing the discomfort of the unknown to be part of my project. Becoming familiar with this is a necessary skill to succeed as a developer.

We all use the web extensively, I am curious how chrome extensions work and are created, so I have set out to create a decently simple project to learn.

## Features of this extension

I want a user to be able to input some text and a cute little character will output the input text at a set cadence.

The character will be animated and be able to be dragged and dropped at the edges of the screen where it will hide (toggle on/off) when not needed
